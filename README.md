#### Design Systems enthusiast, obsessive User Interface Engineer, and Reactish Developer with a vision to bridge the gap between traditional boundaries of development and design.
#### I started programming 7 years ago with Java and Javascript which leads me to commit revolutionizing the #Front-end Development and share my thoughts about this domain and help newcomers acquire techniques and tips through valuable content.

#### I'm an addictive reader with more than 150 books in my pocket about Business, Startups, Design, and Programming. #YDJS, #ATOMICDESIGN, #LEANUX, #LEANSTARTUP are my favorites.

#### My definite aim to work for millennial founders and help them add value to societies and beat their competitors by designing and developing cutting-edge digital experiences for their innovative visions and ideas.
